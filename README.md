Grow Mood provides personalized food recommendations for users based on their emotions, using an interactive widget and preference analysis. We believe this approach not only enhances users' moods but also strengthens their connection to the Grab brand.

In this repository, you'll find `grow_mood_be`, which is the backend and includes an integration with `OpenAI`, and `grow_mood`, which is the frontend implemented as a mobile app using Flutter.
